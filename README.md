Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a bio inspired algorithm and a stochastic method used in
optimization problem. It is modelled after natural processes, such as the flocking of birds or the
movement of schools of fish. PSO is an effective and efficient global search technique. It is an
appropriate algorithm to address feature selection problems due to better representation,
capability of searching large spaces, being less expensive computationally, being easier to
implement, and fewer parameters being required. The purpose of feature selection is to design a
more compact classifier with as little performance degradation as possible. Feature selection
reduces the number of features by eliminating irrelevant and redundant features, resulting in
enhanced accuracy and efficiency. This is especially important when handling a very large data
set with dimensions that run into the thousands. In this project, we incorporate a face recognition
system using the classical Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for feature block selection instead
of a single feature. The proposed face recognition framework can efficiently select distinctive
block feature rather than focusing individual single feature, thereby not only improving feature
selection process but also enhancing the performance of the system. The blocks with the smallest
EERs (Equal Error Rate) are chosen to represent the face image representation and
recognition.The proposed face recognition system may give recognition rate with the accuracy
up to 84.5%.
